    # - The root is an object
    # - The object has the following keys: "name", "bounds", "boxes", and "faces"
    # - "name" is a string
    # - "bounds" is a list of 6 floats

    #     - "texture" is an integer
    #     - "vertices" is a list of objects with the following keys: "pos", "normal", and "uv"
    #         - "pos" is a list of 3 floats
    #         - "normal" is a list of 3 floats
    #         - "uv" is a list of 2 floats
    #     - "normal" is an array of 3 floats
    #     - "face" is an integer representing the direction the face is facing
